# pymavlink_tutorial
This repository contains different pymavlink tutorial tryouts and experimental projects 

Prerequisitory Steps:
  1. Setting up SITL
      - https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html
      - https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html#sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop
      - Refer to the two links above; starting the "sim_vehicle.py" software can be done in the ardupilot/Tools/autotest/ directory, not the one stated in         the first link under "Start SITL simulator". 
      
  3. Setting up QGroundControl
      - https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html
      - Follow the steps in the link above; it's a set of straight forward commands. Shouldn't be too complicated.
  
  5. Preparing Python dependency
      - run pip3(pip) install pymavlink
